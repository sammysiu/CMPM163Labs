For the Unity project, I added a particle system with orange particles to each of the back wheels on the kart.  
The smaller particles scale up in size with the speed of the kart, while the larger particles are left behind as a sort of trail.  
In addition, I switched the track system from the default oval track to the extended track just outside it, and added a ramp.  
I created my own skybox, and changed the sun model to 80's style using a texture from a free library.  
Finally, I changed the horizon mountains to a wireframe material, and changed the colors of the trees and hills.

a. x = u x 7    
b. y = v x -7 + 7  
c. (2.625,5.25) = gray

From left to right:
1. 2nd chosen texture and normal map  
2. 1st chosen texture  
3. 1st chosen texture and normal map  
These three were done in the same way, using three.js built in functionality.  
4. Shader loaded texture  
5. Tiled shader loaded texture  
These two were loaded using shader files. I solved the tile issue by using the built-in mod function.  
For some reason, the tiled cube used the texture file from the first shader cube. Not sure how to fix.
