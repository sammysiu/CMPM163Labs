From left to right:
1. 2nd chosen texture and normal map  
2. 1st chosen texture  
3. 1st chosen texture and normal map  
These three were done in the same way, using three.js built in functionality.  
4. Shader loaded texture  
5. Tiled shader loaded texture  
These two were loaded using shader files. I solved the tile issue by using the built-in mod function.
